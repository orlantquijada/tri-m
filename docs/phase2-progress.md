## Notes / Decisions Log

(Add entries here when blocking or deviating from the plan. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD — task — note`.)

- 2026-05-17 — plan — Phase 2 plan written. 9 tasks across 5 phases (A–E). Order: distributor hardening → distributor CRUD → user assignment → dupe phone → schedules → aging → CSV. Locked: schedules stored in new table, distributor users created server-side via `auth.api.signUpEmail`, CSV streamed server-side as `text/csv`.
- 2026-05-17 — B1 — Plan listed `dashboard.tsx` for the Distributors nav link, but nav lives in `app-sidebar.tsx`. Modified `app-sidebar.tsx` instead; `dashboard.tsx` untouched. Used kebab-case filename `distributor-list.tsx` per project convention (plan said `DistributorList.tsx`).
- 2026-05-17 — B2 — Plan said `DistributorForm.tsx`; used `distributor-form.tsx` (kebab-case convention). Plan said react-hook-form; used `@tanstack/react-form` to match project pattern. Also extended `services/distributors.ts` and `queries.ts` (implicit deps not listed). Used `buttonVariants()` + Link instead of Button+asChild (Button in this project has no asChild prop). Added Edit links to `distributor-list.tsx` and New button to `distributors/index.tsx` for navigation.
- 2026-05-17 — B3 — Plan said `AssignDistributorDialog.tsx`; used `assign-distributor-dialog.tsx` (kebab-case). Plan listed `apps/api/src/routes/users.ts` and `apps/api/src/index.ts` as files; also created `apps/web/src/features/users/queries.ts` (implicit). Zod schemas defined inline in route (not in packages/schema) since they're API-internal. Save button disabled when empty distributor selected to prevent sending undefined distributorId.
- 2026-05-17 — C1 — Lookup triggered on phone field blur (not on keystroke). `lookupPhone` state initialised from `defaultValues.phone` so edit page shows warning immediately if phone already conflicts. Warning filters out `currentCustomerId` client-side so editing a customer's own phone does not self-warn.
- 2026-05-17 — D1 — Plan named `apps/api/src/services/receivable.ts` (singular) but the existing service file is `receivables.ts` (plural). Extended the existing file. Seed sets all schedule statuses to `pending` regardless of date; D2 will derive overdue from `dueDate < today` at query time rather than relying on the status field. Skipped id:5 (fully_paid) per plan ("3 overdue + 5 current").
